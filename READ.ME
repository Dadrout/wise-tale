# WiseTale — AI-Powered Story-Based Learning for Humanities

WiseTale is an AI-driven educational platform that transforms complex topics from humanities subjects (such as History, Geography, Philosophy, and Social Studies) into emotionally engaging and easily digestible **short video fairy tales**. The project is currently focused on humanities education and is designed for students, self-learners, and educators seeking intuitive and story-rich content.

## 🚀 What It Does

WiseTale generates human-like video explainers with audio narration using generative AI. The user selects a subject and topic (e.g., "World War I", "Continental Drift", or "Utilitarianism"), and WiseTale produces:

- 🧠 A clear, accurate explanation in the format of a short story or allegory.
- 🎥 A generated video scene visualizing the concept (Runway/Sora).
- 🎙️ An AI-generated voiceover (ElevenLabs).
- 📄 Transcript of the explanation (via GPT-4o).
- 🧪 (Coming soon) Flashcards and mini-quizzes for reinforcement.

The platform is **accessible via web interface** and is optimized for English-speaking users aged 13–25, especially those seeking more intuitive and less academic learning formats.
